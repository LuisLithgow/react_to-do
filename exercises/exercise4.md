#4. Exercise 4 

## Connect to the DB
 1. Create a `/models/task.js` file. This file will encapsulate all of your db interactions.
 2. Install and require `pg-promise` from this file (and go thank @vitaly!)
 2. Install and require `dotenv` in your server.js. This will simulate an environment without having to mess with your bash profile.
 3. The top of your `/models/task.js` file should look like this:
 ```
 'use strict'
const pg = require('pg-promise')({
    // Initialization Options
});
const config = {
    host:       process.env.DB_HOST,
    port:       process.env.DB_PORT,
    database:   process.env.DB_NAME,
    user:       process.env.DB_USER,
    password:   process.env.DB_PASS,
  };

const _db = pg(config);
```

 5. Create `.env` file in the root of your server directory

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=jseminara
DB_PASS=*********
DB_NAME=taskdb
DB_PORT=5432
NODE_ENV=development
```

## The part where the queries comes in.
 1. Back in `/models/task.js`, export an unnamed object with methods that will serve as middleware.
 3. In `/routes/`, import your middleware from `/models/task.js`; name it `db`. 
 4. Build out your middleware with methods to interact with the database. You should be using `fetch` and setting any results to `res.rows`.
